Junghyuk Yoo is the protagonist of Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World and a regressor trapped in an endless cycle of life and death. 
After failing to survive the apocalyptic scenarios orchestrated by the Star Stream, he regresses upon death, starting over each time with his memories intact. 
Over 1863 regressions, he becomes the strongest player, hardened by loss and betrayal, fixated on clearing the scenarios and destroying the system.
His repeated failures turn him into a cold, ruthless leader who avoids attachments, believing that emotions are a weakness. 
However, in his final regression, he meets Kim Dokja, a mysterious man who knows everything about him. Dokjaâ€™s interference changes the course of his fate, 
challenging his belief that he must endure alone. As the scenarios progress, Junghyuk is forced to confront his past, his trauma, and the possibility that, 
for the first time, he might not have to fight alone.
