    Ramadan is almost here, and I'll be fasting during the final round of the competition. My mind drifts to thoughts of breaking my fast with a glass of **es kolang**-kaling cap Badut. While waiting, I've created a cryptic program hidden within the colored canvas. Can you figure it out?

    For clarity, I made a 10x scaled copy of the art. Both are identical.
