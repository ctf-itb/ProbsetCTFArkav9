    While casually rummaging through an old wardrobe, I stumbled upon a dusty, forgotten phone. Curious, I powered it on, only to realize it's locked with a pattern I can't remember. Now, the phone sits there, holding onto secrets I can't access. Can you figure out the pattern and reveal what's locked away?
