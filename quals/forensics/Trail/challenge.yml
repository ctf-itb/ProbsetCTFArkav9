    It's been a month since I lost my fiancé, and I am deeply grateful to you for investigating and providing me with the chronology of events. It seems that God has answered my prayers. According to the police report, the criminal organization was actually in conflict with another group called Stan. Stan successfully carried out a phishing campaign against them. This morning, I received news that the police managed to arrest the broker responsible for launching the phishing campaign and successfully obtained network traffic data from his computer. While it's unlikely that this case will lead me to my fiancé, I can't help but hold on to a sliver of hope.
