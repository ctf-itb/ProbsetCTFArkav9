    We escaped from the pursuit of those criminals—people who hated my fiancé for investigating evidence in their cybercrime case. I was devastated when I realized he was missing and had been kidnapped, with no clear understanding of the events leading up to it. This is a backup of the data from his computer before he disappeared. Please help me, I'm desperate and deeply worried about him. I love him so much, and this pain is unbearable.
