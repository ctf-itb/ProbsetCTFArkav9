    While I was desperately searching for my fiancé's whereabouts, someone sent me an email containing ransomware named Chizuru. How dare they make fun of me when I was already feeling lost? The ransomware also encrypted one of my most memorable files with my fiancé. It felt like the whole world was turning against me.
