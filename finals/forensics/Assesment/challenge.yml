    After I woke up, the leader of the Shadow Killers asked me to join them. He threatened to hurt Chizuru if I refused. But after hearing their vision—a group of outcasts seeking justice in their own way—I saw that their ideals matched mine. I accepted, on the condition that I'd still live freely like a normal person. I know joining them means I can't be with Chizuru, but I trust God has a plan for us. To prove myself, I've been tasked with investigating the theft of crucial data needed to defeat the Stan organization. It's time they see who I really am.
